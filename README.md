# Introducing FakeDataMaker

Need dummy data for testing? Well look no further.
FakeDataMaker for Java can generate all kinds of garbage data like:

* Phone Numbers
* First and Last Names
* Random Dates
* Email Address
* Mailing Addresses
* URLs and more!!!

## Mini-Roadmap

### Soonish

* Username generation for major online providers
* Company Names
* Better URL generation
* Documentation with Examples (there are some BDD tests though you can look at now)
* US-centric random data generation

### A Little Later

* Housecleaning (packaging and stuff)
* Canadian-centric random data generation
* UK-centric random data generation
* Australian-centric random data generation

### Someday / Maybe / Maybe Not

_(The order listed here may or may not be the actual order of when I start working on them.)_

* German-centric random data generation
* French-centric random data generation
* Mainland Chinese-centric random data generation
* Japanese-centric random data generation
* Taiwanese-centric random data generation
* Spain-centric random data generation
* Get this working stand alone, dumping data directly into the data store of choice.
* Other EU members that I missed listing here
* Make this into a Maven module
* OSGI module?
